"""Appointment tracking: the trucks the planner picks on Results, one row per shipment.

Picking a truck snapshots its loads (stop order, ETA, volume, contact) so the list stays
as it was requested even if the plan is edited later; the planner then sets each
shipment's status (requested / pending / confirmed) on the Appointments page.
